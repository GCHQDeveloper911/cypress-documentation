title: Do I need to write tests?

Probably.

Writing tests is typically not a requirment for an application or feature, but it should be. Afterall, don't you want to make sure that your application or new feature is working the way it was intended to?

## I don't have enough time to write tests

If we had a nickel...

This is often used as an excuse as to why a person or team do not write tests. This problem is easily solveable. If testing is important to you and your team, you will make the time that is necessary to write them. While estimating how long a new feature, bug fix, or refactor may take, always make sure to factor in the time it will take to write tests.

Writing tests will no doubt increase the amount of time it takes to implement a new feature, upfront. However, the amount of time you save from debugging later on, not to mention the confidence you will have, is well worth the upfront cost. This is one of those things that has to be experienced first hand in order for you to understand the value.

Next time you or your team need to implement a new feature, write tests for that feature, and monitor the results.
